# Passion
What really is passion? The concept of wanting something so bad that you will do anything for it. Think, are you willing to learn one thing just so you can get what you want? 

My personal passion is coding and making things out of thin air (so basically programming) and I think one of the reasons I love it so much is because of how easily you can automate things and make them better for the sake of the people using the tools.

Personally I think the way passion works is that when someone truly loves some one/thing something clicks inside them and they know they love it.
