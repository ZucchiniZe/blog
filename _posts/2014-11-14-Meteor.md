[Meteor][mt] is one of the best frameworks that I have come across. Reasons being: 
1. Shared client and server code
2. Very small file structure
3. Hot code push
4. Live reload for development server
5. Lots of packages from the community

## Lets talk about reason #1: Shared client and server code
One of the most useful things in meteor is the shared client and server code. For example when you create an application it scaffolds out 3 file, a HTML file, a CSS file, and a JS file. In the JS file there is two if statements: `if(Meteor.isClient` and `if(Meteor.isServer)`.

The first if block runs on the client where you put your template helpers and events. Then the second block runs on the server where you define your models and things.

## Reason #2: Very small file structure
When you scaffold an application in meteor it gives only produces 3 files, `<app>.{hmtl,js,css}` which just contain a simple counter application. But once you get creating a larger meteor application you usually create multiple directories: `/client` for client code, `/lib` for code that is shared between the client and the server such as db collections, `/server` for server code, and `/public` for static assets like images.

## Reason #3: Hot code pushing
Personally this is the feature that I love the most. Hot code pushing allows you to push your code to people who are viewing your site in production as soon as you push it.

It is also used on the dev server so when you update a CSS file it just injects the code into the site. Also when you change a file that applies to the server meteor rebuild your application to prevent errors.

## Reason #4: Live reload for development server
This is practically the same thing as hot code pushing except it watches for file changes instead of code pushes.

## Reason #5: Lots of packages from the community
The reason I say this is because currently (11/14/14) there are 2651 packages on [atmosphere][at] which is the central repository for all meteor packages. There are also a crap-ton of tutorials out there on how to write a Meteor app. There is also a [book][dm] which teaches you how to create somewhat of a [hacker news][hn] clone called microscope.
